	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<p>Voice is a non-profit organization founded in 2010, with the hope of eliminating bullying and insecurities among teens and young adults. Voice works to improve self-esteem, recognizing that low self-esteem is the root cause of bullying and insecurities among teens. By giving a voice to those who have been affected by these situations, Voice hopes to bring awareness to the community of their dangerous effects, with the overall hope that one day these problems can and will be eliminated.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<h2 id="four">Why Voice?</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<p>I created my organization Voice during my fall semester of my senior year of high school. Having been a victim of bullying myself, I had experienced first hand some of the negative effects, including a very bruised and fragile self-esteem that contributed to countless insecurities. High school was a tipping point for me, and as I struggled to leave behind who I was for who I was becoming, I became aware of just how difficult erasing past habits and ways of thinking could be. As my confidence grew, so did my desire to help others. Since its founding, Voice has worked tirelessly to educate communities of people about the effects of bullying, insecurities, and low-self esteem. It is my personal belief that through education, we can improve this grim situation.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<p class="col-md-4">Voice has given several educational speeches and presentations to various members of the community, with the hope that through education will come elimination. Voice has presented at the elementary, middle, high school, and collegiate levels. Our clients have included: Lansdale Catholic High School, Landale PA, Saint Agnes-Sacred Heart School, Sellersville and Hilltown, PA and Bucks County Community College, Perkasie, PA...to name a few.</p> 
		<p class="col-md-4">Voice has conducted several photo campaigns to promote a higher level of self-esteem. Our programs have included: The "Insecure" campaign, in which photos were submitted containing the individuals biggest insecurity. The "You're Beautiful" campaign, in which photos were submitted containing the individuals favorite feature about themselves. Currently in the works is our,"You Were Wrong" campaign in which individuals will submit situations in which they were put down, and then succeed in spite of the negative comments, this information will be transformed into creative art form and displayed on our website to promote higher self-esteem.</p>
		<p class="col-md-4">Voice has conducted ribbon awareness campaigns on several occasions. These campaigns take place in the month of October, National Anti-Bullying or Bullying Awareness Month. The hope is that the ribbons commemorate all those who have been victims of bullying and that by taking a ribbon, those participating are taking a vow to help in the fight to end bullying</p>
